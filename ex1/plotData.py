# ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
# Instructions: Plot the training data into a figure using the
#               "figure" and "scatter" commands. Set the axes labels using
#               the "xlabel" and "ylabel" commands. Assume the
#               population and revenue data have been passed in
#               as the x and y arguments of this function.
#
# Hint: You can use the 'marker' and color option with plot to have 
#       the markers appear as red crosses. 


	plt.figure() # open a new figure window
